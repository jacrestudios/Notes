Missions:
1. Capture and Protect
2. Hunting Party
3. Looting and Sabotage
4. Rescue
5. Quadrant Control

1. Capture and Protect
+3 OP for Capturing Enemy Beacon
+2 OP for Capturing with Datatracker
+1 OP for bringing beacon to DZ
+3 OP for preventing capture of your own beacon
+1 (2) for Classified

Notes:  
-Going second is a good strategic decision as it gives you a better chance
to make a last minute grab for the beacon without giving your opponent a chance to respond.
A highly durable datatracker may be able to simply walk up and place their hand on the beacon
putting you 5 OP above the opponent alone.  
-Because the mission ends in retreat, a player going first can beat their opponent into submission
then make the grab, giving them too limited of resources to respond.
-Mines are very important in this mission, as they
can still protect a beacon despite smoke.  
-Airborne Deployment or Infilitrated Hidden Deployment 
will also be useful as ways to chase down a runaway beacon.  
-Picking a Gear classified can substitute for
the requirement to bring the beacon back to the DZ.
